# commerce
It is a website for auctions on items and bids from customers, any one can post auction and the biggest bid wins, then seller can sell the item to the customer.
I developed it with DJANGO in python language and created its database with sqlite then converted it to postgresql for deploying.

I also contributed in its frontend with html, css and javascript.

I deployed this website on heroku.
